# Short Answer Feedback Generation Baseline
**!!! Version 3.0 of this dataset can now be found [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/Short-Answer-Feedback)!!!**

This repository contains the dataset and code corresponding to the paper *"Your Answer is Incorrectâ€¦ Would you like to know why? Introducing a Bilingual Short Answer Feedback Dataset"* (Filighera et al., ACL 2022). 
1. The experiments were run with a conda python environment using python version 3.7.10.
   The environment to reproduce our results can be installed in the following way (for windows, uncomment pywin32=300 in requirements.txt):
> conda create --name baseline python=3.7  
> conda activate baseline  
> conda install pytorch==1.7.1 torchvision==0.8.2 torchaudio==0.7.2 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch  
> pip install -r requirements.txt  
> pip install bert-score
2. Download and copy your data set into the *data* folder or ensure that SAF is there.

Download and copy the data set into the repository.

3. Run the preprocessing script to preprocess the data set, optionally edit the file path and hyperparameters in the script
> python preprocessing.py
4. Run the finetuning script to train the models. Adjust variable mode to select which experiment setting you want to use, you can also edit hyperparameters here
> python finetuning.py
5. A model can be tested by running the testing script. Adjust model path, language and data paths in the script.
> python testing.py
6. Testing saves the model predictions to a file, which can then be utilized to calculate and print out the BERT score. As file convention, the file should start with the experiment mode.
> python bert_scoring.py
7. We also provide an example script for inference with a finetuned model (using our code) and a json file that contains a question, a reference answer, and a list of student answers.  
> python inference.py  

You may also adjust the seeding in the litT5.py script.
